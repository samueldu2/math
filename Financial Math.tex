Welcome to my math book on Financial Math


Chapter 1: Forwards, Futures, and Swaps
\paragraph{Forward Prices}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Forwards on stock S(t)\\
	Base on no arbitrage arguments of using debt S(t) to buy and hold one share to sell at time T, we find:

 \begin{center} F(t) = ${e^{r(T-t)}}$ S(t) \end{center}
 
 Similarly,
 
 \item Forwards on stock paying dividend rate q
 
 \begin{center} F(t) = ${e^{(r-q)(T-t)}}$ S(t) \end{center}
 
 \item Forwards on foreign currency priced S(t) in domestic currency and paying foreign interest rate ${r_f}$
 	\begin{center} F(t) = ${e^{(r-r_f)(T-t)}}$ S(t) \end{center}
 	
 \item Problems with Forward Contracts \\
 	Counter party risk and liquidity risks
 \end{itemize}

\paragraph{Futures Prices}

 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Future prices and forward prices are identical if interest rate is deterministic
	\item 
  
\end{itemize}
